# **GIF to moving ASCII ART**

This Python script converts GIF into moving ASCII art in real-time, 
displaying the animation in the terminal or output of VSC. 
By mapping pixels to ASCII characters by converting the gif into a gray scaled version of itself (dividing the rgb values by 3)

## **Libraries:**
- Pillow
- time
- sys
- os

## **How to Run:**
1. Place the GIF file you want to convert into the same folder as this script. Rename the file to amogus-among-us.gif or update the gifName variable in the script to match your file name.
2. then run in cmd : python ascii_art_generator.py
